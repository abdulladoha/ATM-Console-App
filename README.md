A simple ATM-Console app which takes a user's card number and pin to:

1. Deposit
2. Withdraw
3. Show balance
4. Exit

The program can detect whether a card number is on the database.
If not, it will say "Card not recognised. Please try again". 
If correct, it will say "Please enter your pin: ".
If incorrect, it will say "Incorrect pin. Please try again".
